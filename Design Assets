Design Process & Contributing

The DiLog specification is being developed in the spec repository. For now, high-level design discussions should continue to be held in the design repository, via issues and pull requests, so that the specification work can remain focused.

We've mapped out features we expect to ship:

An initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) release;
And soon after in future versions.
